## General Homework Directions

- Each `/hw*` directory will have instructions for that week's assignment.
- You'll submit your assignment under a new directory named`/lastName-firstName` in `/hw*/_submissions`.
  - For example: `hw2/_submissions/schrute-mose`.
- You'll create a new branch named `lastName-firstName` for each assignment and push your changes to GitHub from that branch as a pull request to merge into the master branch.
- Your pull request will be approved and merged into master after being looked at by instructors.
